Request to contributors

A lot of people reading this have been seized by the urge to send me some bit of lore or trivia for inclusion. Thank you, but bear in mind that the most important choice is what to leave out. Here are some guidelines:

    I’m trying to describe common knowledge at the time. That means not every bit of fascinating but obscure trivia belongs here.

    Anything from a tech generation before early minis - in particular the era of mainframes, punched cards, and paper tape - is out of scope. I gotta draw the line somewhere, and it’s there.

    Stories about isolated survivals of old tech today are not interesting if the tech wasn’t once common knowledge.

    Please do not send me timeline entries for dates which you think are important unless you think the date has generally been forgotten, or is in serious danger of same.

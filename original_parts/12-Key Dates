Key dates

These are dates that every hacker knew were important at the time, or shortly afterwards. I’ve tried to concentrate on milestones for which the date - or the milestone itself - seems to have later passed out of folk memory.

1961

    MIT takes delivery of a PDP-1. The first recognizable ancestor of the hacker culture of today rapidly coalesces around it.
1969

    Ken Thompson begins work on what will become Unix. First commercial VDT ships; it’s a glass TTY. First packets exchanged on the ARPANET, the direct ancestor of today’s Internet.
1970

    DEC PDP-11 first ships; architectural descendants of this machine, including later Intel microprocessors, will come to dominate computing.
1973

    Interdata 32 ships; the long 32-bit era begins [15]. Unix Edition 5 (not yet on the Interdata) escapes Bell Labs to take root at a number of educational institutions. The XEROX Alto pioneers the "workstation" - a networked personal computer with a high-resolution display and a mouse.
1974

    CP/M first ships; this will be the OS for a large range of microcomputers until effectively wiped out by MS-DOS after 1981. MS/DOS will, however, have been largely cloned from CP/M; this theft leaves rather unmistakable traces in the BIOS. It’s also why MS-DOS has filenames with at most 8 characters of name and 3 of extension.
1975

    First Altair 8800 ships; beginning of heroic age of microcomputers. First 24x80 and 25x80 "smart" (addressable-cursor) VDTs. ARPANET declared "operational", begins to spread to major universities.
1976

    "Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition, with Source Code" released. First look into the Unix kernel source for most hackers, and was a huge deal in those pre-open-source days. First version of ADVENT is written. First version of the Emacs text editor.
1977

    Unix ported to the Interdata; first version with a kernel written largely in C rather than machine-dependent assembler. Second generation of home computers (Apple II and TRS-80 Model 1) ship. SCCS, the first version-control system, is publicly released.
1978

    First BBS launched - CBBS, in Chicago.
1979

    MIT Dungeon, later known as Zork, is written; the first grues lurk in dark places.
1980

    Rogue, ancestral to all later top-view dungeon-crawling games, is invented. USENET begins.
1981

    First IBM PC ships; end of the heroic age of micros. TCP/IP is implemented on a VAX-11/780 under 4.1BSD Unix; ARPANET and Unix cultures begin to merge.
1982

    After some false starts from 1980-1981 with earlier 68000-based micros of similar design, the era of commercial Unix workstations truly begins with the founding and early success of Sun Microsystems. RCS, the second version-control system, ships.
1983

    PDP-10 canceled; this is effectively the end of 36-bit architectures anywhere outside of deep mainframe country, though Symbolics Lisp machines hold out a while longer. ARPANET, undergoing some significant technical changes, becomes Internet.
1984

    AT&T begins a largely botched attempt to commercialize Unix, clamping down on access to source code. In the BBS world, FidoNet is invented. The patch(1) utility is invented.
1985

    RMS published GNU Manifesto. This is also roughly the year the C language became the dominant lingua franca of both systems and applications programming, eventually displacing earlier compiled language so completely that they are almost forgotten. First Model M keyboard ships.
1986

    Intel 386 ships; end of the line for 8- and 16-bit PCs. Consumer-grade hardware in this class wouldn’t be generally available until around 1989, but after that would rapidly surpass earlier 32-bit minicomputers and workstations in capability.
1987

    USENET undergoes the Great Renaming. Perl, first of the modern scripting languages, is invented.
1991

    Linux and the World Wide Web are (separately) launched. Python scripting language invented.
1992

    Bit-mapped color displays with a dot pitch matching that of a monochrome VDT (and a matching ability to display crisp text at 80x25) ship on consumer-grade PCs. Bottom falls out of the VDT market.
1993

    Linux gets TCP/IP capability, moves from hobbyist’s toy to serious OS. America OnLine offers USENET access to its users; "September That Never Ended" begins. Mosaic adds graphics and image capability to the World Wide Web.
1994

    Mass-market Internet takes off in the U.S. USB promulgated.
1995-1996

    Peak years of UUCP/USENET and the BBS culture, then collapse under pressure from mass-market Internet.
1997

    I first give the "Cathedral and Bazaar" talk.
1999

    Banner year of the dot-com bubble. End of workstation era: Market for Suns and other proprietary Unix workstations collapses under pressure from Linux running on PCs.
2000

    Subversion first ships.
2001

    Dot-com bubble pops. PC hardware with workstation-class capabilities becomes fully commoditized; pace of visible innovation in mass-market computers slows noticeably.
2005

    Major manufacturers cease production of cathode-ray tubes in favor of flat-panel displays. Flat-panels have been ubiquitous on new hardware since about 2003. There is a brief window until about 2007 during which high-end CRTs no longer in production still exceed the resolution of flat-panel displays and are still sought after. Also in 2005, AOL drops USENET support and Endless September ends. Git first ships.
2007-2008

    64-bit transition in mass market PCs; the 32-bit era ends. Single-processor speeds plateau at 4±0.25GHz. iPhone and Android (both with Unix-based OSes) first ship.

FTP, Gopher, and the forgotten pre-Web

The World Wide Web went from nowhere to ubiquity during a few short years in the early 1990s. Before that, from 1971 onwards, file transfer between Internet sites was normally done with a tool named ftp, for the File Transfer Protocol it used. Every hacker once knew how to use this tool.

Eventually ftp was mostly subsumed by web browsers speaking the FTP protocol themselves. This is why you may occasionally still see URLs with an "ftp:" service prefix; this informs the browser that it should expect to speak to an FTP server rather than an HTTP/HTTPS server.

There was another. The same year (1991) that Tim Berners-Lee was inventing the World Wide Web, a group of hackers at the University of Minnesota devised "Gopher", a hypertext protocol that was menu-centric rather than link-centric. For a few years Gopher competed vigorously with the early Web, and many hackers used both. Adoption was stalled when the University decided to charge a license fee for its implementation in early 1993. Then, early Web browsers added the ability to speak Gopher protocol and display Gopher documents. By 2000 Gopher was effectively dead, although a few Gopher servers are still operated in a spirit of nostalgia and irony.
